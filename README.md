# node-snapdrop

This is a copy of [node-snapdrop](https://github.com/Bellisario/node-snapdrop) (by [Bellisario](https://github.com/Bellisario)), which is just the original [Snapdrop](https://github.com/RobinLinus/Snapdrop) (by [RobinLinus](https://github.com/RobinLinus)), but with a complete Node.js server.

## Why this fork?

This fork of node-snapdrop has been created to:

- Translate the Snapdrop UI to German.
- Add a QR code to the UI
- Host an own Snapdrop server at [drop.rafaelurben.ch](https://drop.rafaelurben.ch).

## Getting started

To get started, clone and cd the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafaelurben/node-snapdrop.git && cd node-snapdrop
```

Install all dependencies with NPM:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the server with:

```bash
node index.js
```

### Public Run

If you want to run in your public "sharable" IP instead of locally, you can use this command:

```bash
node index.js public
```

> [!TIP]
> Remember to check your IP Address using your OS command to see where you can access the server.
